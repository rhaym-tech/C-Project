# EtuManger

An awesome student management system that allows a school or university to track information about its students, such as their names, contact details, courses, grades, attendance, and other relevant data. The program must be able to read from and write to a file to store and retrieve student data.


# About EtuManger

The student management system must have a menu-based user interface that allows administrators or teachers to perform various tasks, such as:
1. **Add Students:** The program must allow users to add new students to the system by entering their names, contact details and other relevant information.
2. **Update student information:** The program must allow users to update student information if there are any changes, such as a change of address or phone number.
3. **Delete Students:** The program must allow users to delete a student's information from the system if they have left school or university.
4. **View Students:** The program must allow users to view student information.
