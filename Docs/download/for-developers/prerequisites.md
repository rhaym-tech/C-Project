# ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

### GNU (GNU Compiler Collection):

The **GNU Compiler Collection** is an optimizing compiler produced by the **GNU Project** supporting various programming languages, inclduing **C language**

{% tab title="Windows" %}
In order to install GCC on Windows, you need a toolkit such as MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) to install it:

1. Download and install MinGW:&#x20;

MinGW official Download link
{% endembed %}

2. Install needed packages:

Mark this following packages for installation:

* **`mingw32-base`**
* **`mingw32-gcc-g++`**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click with right button on package to view options and select "Mark for installation"</p></figcaption></figure>

then click on "Installation -> Apply Changes":

Now confirm installation and wait until it finishs and click "Close"

3. Add GCC to the PATH:

Currently, the command prompt cannot detect the **GCC** because the environment path variable has not been set. \
Follow the steps below to set the environment path variable for MinGW on the Windows system.

{% hint style="info" %}
The environment path variable helps to detect the compiler in your whole system. It makes the alias name for the compiler, which denotes the path.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to MinGW installation folder "default: C:\\\MinGW\\" and copy "bin" folder's adress (Default: "C:\\\MinGW\bin").
2. Click on Windows Search bar and type "Environment Variables" or "PATH"\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)
3. Click on "PATH" then "Edit" button\
   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
4. Now click on "New" and paste the "/bin" folder address then click "OK"![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)



And finally, you've GCC installed Successfully!, now you can compile C programs using gcc command:

```
gcc <filename>.c -o <filename>.exe //command
/*
Example: Compiling a C program I named myProject
gcc myProject.c -o myProject.exe
*/
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GNU/Linux" %}
In order to install GCC on Linux, you just need to run this command:

| Distro                                                       |                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| <p><strong>Debian</strong> or<br><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p> | **`sudo apt install build-essential`**          |
| **Arch Linux**                                               | **`sudo pacman -S base-devel`**                 |
| **Fedora** or **Red Hat**                                    | **`sudo dnf install gcc`**                      |
| **CentOS** or **RHEL**                                       | **`sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`** |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
To install **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** on **macOS**, you can use the package manager **Homebrew**. Here's how to do it:

1.  Install **Homebrew** if you haven't already. Open **Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2.  Once **Homebrew** is installed, update it by running:

    ```
    brew update
    ```
3.  Install **GCC** by running the following command:

    ```
    brew install gcc
    ```
4.  After the installation completes, you can verify that **GCC** is installed by checking its version:

    ```
    gcc --version
    ```

That's it! **GCC** should now be installed on your **macOS** system using **Homebrew**.
